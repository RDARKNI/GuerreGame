# GUERRE

## Compilation Instructions

### Non-Cross Compilation (Unix-like Systems)

1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Make sure the `ncurses` library is installed on your system. It is typically pre-installed on most Unix-like systems.

2. **Create and Navigate to Build Directory**:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Configure the Project with CMake**:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Cross-Compiling from Unix to Windows

1. **Install Zig**: Ensure you have Zig installed and added to your systemâ€™s PATH. If Zig is not on your PATH, specify the path directly in the compile command.

2. **Compile Using Zig**:
    ```bash
    zig c++ -o ./bin/windows/guerre.exe -I./extern/ ./src/main.cpp ./extern/libpdcurses.a ./src/input_parser.cpp ./src/ui/menu_ui.cpp ./src/ui/ncurses_setup.cpp ./src/game_model/pion.cpp ./src/game_model/game.cpp ./src/controller/controller.cpp ./src/controller/data_handler.cpp ./src/controller/network_helper.cpp -std=c++23 -target x86_64-windows -lws2_32
    ```
